		<h1container> <h1 class ="third-page"> HTML </h1></h1container>
		<pcontainer><p class ="sticky third-page"> I saw a youtube video that caught my attention. The video in question was about 
			making a simple animation to occur while scrolling down. This inspired the skeleton of the HTML, CSS,
			and JS to what it is now. <br><br>

			The webpage begins with a navigation bar at the top, as most websites do. What’s different
			about this nav bar is that it sticks to the top of the page at all times, meaning that it sticks at the
			top of the page even if the user is scrolling down. <br><br>

			The body is separated into different section but they’re called div in the project. Each div
			has a height of 125vh (viewport height). This means every one of the div fills up the entire
			browser’s screen space and 25% more on top of that. Within every div has different contents,
			whether it be texts or images or even background images. This goes on for 5 pages. <br><br>

			And the first one being the “login” page. It is originally supposed to be a .php site, where it takes
			the user’s name and displays the name on the right side of the nav bar, as if giving the user a
			welcome message. But instead, for html, the login page just has an input type = “text" and an
			input type = “submit” element, and they aren’t used practically as part of the user experience.
			But the virtue of having those elements present shows that we have applied one of the things
			we’ve learned, which is having an input element somewhere along the 5 pages.

	</div>

	<div class="hidden third-page">
		<h1container><h1 class ="sticky third-page"> CSS </h1></h1container>
		<pcontainer><p class ="sticky third-page"> It begins by importing a google font called “poppins” which is the font present 
			across all the webpages. Every content inside the div has texts in the center. The nav bar has the same
			color as the background, but lighter so as to differentiate the two.When any items on the navbar are hovered, it changes 
			color to clearly indicate that it’s a clickable element. <br><br>

			There are two classes that are actively being used by most if not every text element in the
			webpage, those being the hidden and show classes. Hidden, as the name suggests, hides the
			element in the webpage by reducing its opacity to 0. Show, much the same as the name
			suggests by changing the opacity back to 1. These transitions all happen within 1 second, so
			the user can see the effect of the classes. <br><br>
			
			I’ve also added a transform property where the hidden class starts at the very edge of the
			screen. This is done by writing: transform:translateX(-100%). It changes the X position of the
			element to -100%. Think of it like a string of numbers from -100 to 100. At the very center will be
			0, whereas -100 will be at the left end of the string. The Show class sets the transform value to
			translateX(0). When this is all done in a span of 1 second, the effect intended will be the texts
			flying from the left side, then stopping at the center, while being invisible to visible.
			It also uses a blur effect while hidden, and removes the effect when shown. <br><br>

			For the nav bar sticking at the top, the ul element has a position: sticky in its selector. This
			is so that when the user has scrolled further down than the element’s original position, it will
			decide to stick on the page, following the user. This stops at the end of that container, in this
			case, the container is body, so the nav bar can follow you until the bottom of the page. But if I
			create a div and inside that div, a p with position: sticky, and a text inside it, the contents
			of the p element will follow the user until the edge of the div container. <br><br>

			There is a section in one of the webpages where a background image was used. This is done
			through using the background-image and background-size property. All you have to do is to
			create a class for that container, then in the class selector, write url(“image.png”), and cover
			as their values, respectively. <br><br>
 
			The background images’ heights are set to 200vh as the div is only 125vh which isn’t enough
			to show the entire image. This is because if you set the background size to cover, the image
			will stretch out to fit the container’s size, that being 125vh, and it does it proportionally, meaning
			if the height of an image is set to a certain size, so will the width, and vice-versa.
			The problem here however, is that the height of the image is larger than the height of the
			container, causing it to block certain parts of the image, whether that be the top half, or bottom
			half, which is why I’ve increased the height of the container so it can hopefully match the
			image’s.

		<h1container><h1 class ="sticky third-page"> Javascript </h1></h1container>
		<pcontainer><p class ="sticky third-page"> For JS, I’ve only coded it for the hidden and show class, where I used an
			IntersectionObserver constructor and assigned it into a constant named observer. It has a
			callback function that executes when an observed element intersects with the viewport.
			Then inside it, it iterates over each entry (element) in the array. After that, it has a conditional
			statement that checks if the entry is intersecting with the viewport or not. If the entry intersects
			with the viewport, it adds a class show to the element’s classList. If it’s not intersecting, it
			removes the class show. <br><br>

			I then make a line of code that selects all the elements with the class called hidden, and store it
			in a variable called hiddenElements. Then another line where it iterates over each element in
			hiddenElements’ NodeList using the method forEach(). The observe() method of
			IntersectionOberserver is then called with the element as the argument which would be like:
			observe(div class = “hidden”). When the element div enters or exits the viewport, the
			callback function provided to the IntersectionObserver constructor will be invoked.

		<h1container><h1 class ="sticky third-page"> Critical Reflection </h1></h1container>
		<pcontainer><p class ="sticky third-page"> I think this project was cool. Making it was a lot of fun. I learned a ton of new 
			things about front-end development. Something I didn’t understand that much would be the syntax and
			anything related to Javascript. I don’t really know anything about this programming language as
			of now, so I had to settle with a simple mechanic as a stepping stone for now. <br><br>

			What’s really cool about this project is that the way it displays the contents is very smooth. And
			the background images and images add taste to the webpage as a whole. It really is one of the
			webpages of all time. <br><br>

			Things that could be improved are things like adding more content into the web page, since as
			of now, it has very little content available in it. It only has pictures and texts in it, but I plan on
			adding more things I learn to the webpage, so there’s a chance that I might update the Github
			files long after I’ve submitted this project. <br><br>

			For these things to happen I need to learn new concepts in css like which properties I could
			manipulate and what do the properties do. I would also need to learn more about Javascript and
			what It could do in HTML. As for HTML, I probably need to learn more about conventional use of
			elements because I failed to do that in this project, and that is when I used a  instead of. 
			That could definitely be improved. <br><br>

			Overall, I think I need to familiarize myself with certain CSS design tricks and a whole lot of JS
			interactions with CSS. This would include the functions, methods, constructors and whatever
			else. Only then will I understand the world of front-end development. <br><br>
